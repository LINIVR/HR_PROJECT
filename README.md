The primary objective of this project was to predict an applicant's future wage accurately by leveraging domain-specific parameters. Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated for predictions, including Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest Regression, Robust Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression. To evaluate the performance of these algorithms, metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared were used. Among the tested algorithms, Gradient Boosting Regression demonstrated superior performance with an MSE of 75099.96 and an R-squared value of 0.99, indicating high predictive power. Finally, the model was deployed on the web using Flask for accessibility.
