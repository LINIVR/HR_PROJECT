The primary objective of this project was to predict an applicant's future wage accurately by leveraging domain-specific parameters. Multiple machine learning models were trained and utilized for predictions, including Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest Regression, Robust Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression. To evaluate the performance of these algorithms, a classification report was generated for comparison. Among the algorithms tested, Gradient Boosting Regression demonstrated superior performance. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) achieved was 75099.96, and the R-squared value was 0.99, indicating high accuracy. Finally, the model was deployed on the web using Flask for accessibility.
